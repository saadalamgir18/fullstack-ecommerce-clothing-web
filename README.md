# Full Stack E-Commerce Clothing Website

This project is a full stack e-commerce website built with Next js. I created this project as an exercise to develop my web development skills, especially to learn about Next js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
